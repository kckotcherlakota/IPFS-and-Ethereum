# IPFS-and-Ethereum
An Ethereum and IPFS based file sharing app.

The global daily data generation is estimated to be more than 2.5 quintillion bytes and more than 90 per cent of the total data produced is generated in the last two years. Most of this data is produced through various sources such as Search Platforms, Social Media, Data Sharing Platforms and E-Commerce. The third-party entities which provide these services often have great control over the data produced. This caused a lot of issues including data manipulation, lack of privacy and data leaks historically and is not just limited to the fields mentioned. Peer to Peer networks partly solve this problem but are prone to several security vulnerabilities. The motivation behind this research is to eliminate the centralized agencies and to promote a fully decentralized and secure file system which can create a transparent and secure Internet. The proposed protocol allows independent nodes to share data directly to desired destinations without leaking the contents to the remaining nodes in the network and without the need of any central agency. It integrates IPFS distributed hypermedia protocol and Ethereum to enable complete decentralization. IPFS provides a distributed Hash Table and a secure data exchange mechanism. Ethereum adds another layer of security through its immutable ledger and Smart Contracts in Ethereum creates a secure mechanism for initiating data-based payments. This paper also focuses on improving the current caching mechanism in IPFS with a novel caching protocol and privacy concerns in Ethereum by integrating a secure Zero Knowledge Proof mechanism.
